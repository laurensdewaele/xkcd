Dan is busy man. He's a professional software engineer with over 30 years of experience. Aside from his engineering role, he's been known to take up roles such as scrum-master, project manager and team lead.
Above all that, he's a decidated father and husband.

Whenever Dan does find some free me-time, he loves nothing more than to read his favourite comic, xkcd.

Not only does the comic align with his kind of humor, it provides him with a sense of purpose and makes him feel connected to other nerds.

Personality traits:

- Strong ratio.
- Likes things simple and efficient.
- Into performance and optimizations.

## Requirements

As per established target audience;

- The reader needs to be simple, efficient and fast.

## Implementation

- The target audience <em>probably</em> has decent hardware and up to date software. This means we can get away with using solely `webp` for our images, thus improving performance.
- Stick to the basics, no frameworks, in order to keep simplicity and improve performance.
