## Persona

Dan is busy man. He's a professional software engineer with over 30 years of experience. Aside from his engineering role, he's been known to take up roles such as scrum-master, project manager and team lead.
Above all that, he's a decidated father and husband.

Whenever Dan does find some free me time, he loves nothing more than to read his favourite comic, xkcd.

Not only does the comic align with his kind of humor, it provides him with a sense of purpose and it makes him feel connected to other nerds.

Personality traits:

- Strong ratio.

- Into performance and optimizations.

## Requirements

- The reader needs to simple, efficient and fast.
- Needs thumbnails and detail view.
- Needs to be maintainable.

## Implementation

- I image the target audience has decent hardware en up to date software. This means we can get away with using solely webp for our images, thus improving performance.
- Stick to the basics, no frameworks. in order to keep simplicity. Also from a maintainability standpoint.
