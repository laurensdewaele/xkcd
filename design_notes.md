# Design notes

## What are the important features of a good reader?

- It needs to show you the latest comic (or the ones you haven't read.)
  -> It might be interesting to keep track of the ones you've read
- It needs to be fast AF,

- It could be cool to see which ones are the favorites, so if you haven't read most of them,
  you can start by reading the coolest ones.
- It needs to read well. They're all images. Pinch to zoom is the way to go.
  -> See how they do it on the mobile apps
  -> It needs to fit the screen and you can zoom.

-> Link to explain comic

-> Alt text needs to be read somehow.

## Target audience:

- Nerds, lol.

What do nerds like?

What do nerds have?

- The latest browsers -> you can support webp solely without aggravating to many users.
