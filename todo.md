# Todo

## Done

- Made irc post + reddit post (give it some time)

## Large prio

- Code the scraper + image optimizer.
- Design the webapp 

## Small prio

- Figure out how to build the ideal vision you've got in your mind (Figma style)

### Steps to completion

1) Design - this needs to be parrellel, don't let it be a blocking issue - start coding
2) Coding:
    - The frontend app: research what it would be like if you were to use a canvas/2d engine with pinch zoom
    - The data -> you can start by building a scraper and format the data + images.
